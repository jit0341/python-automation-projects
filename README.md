🐍 Python Automation Projects — Freelance Portfolio

I build **production-ready Python automation solutions** that replace manual work with reliable scripts.

This portfolio showcases **real client-style workflows** — data cleaning, SQL reporting, business automation, and repeatable report generation.

Every project here is:
• business-focused  
• execution-proven  
• structured for client delivery  

These are **not practice scripts**, but automation pipelines I use in freelance proposals and client demos.
