# 📂 Folder File Organiser (Python Automation)

A Python automation script that organises mixed files into
clean, categorized folders automatically.

This project simulates a **real client use-case** where
downloads or messy folders need instant organisation.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Folders often contain mixed files like:
- Images
- Videos
- Documents
- Unknown formats

Manually sorting them is:
❌ Time-consuming  
❌ Error-prone  

---

## ✅ Solution

This script scans a target folder and automatically sorts files into:

- Documents/
- Images/
- Videos/
- Others/

Based on file extensions.
